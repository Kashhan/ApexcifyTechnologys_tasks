question,answer
What is artificial intelligence,Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science where machines are designed to perform tasks that normally require human thinking such as reasoning learning and decision making.
What is machine learning,Machine learning is a method in which computers learn patterns from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.
What is deep learning,Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi layer neural networks to learn complex patterns in data.
What is a dataset,A dataset is a collection of labeled or unlabeled data examples used to train test and validate machine learning models.
What is supervised learning,Supervised learning is a learning method where models are trained with labeled data meaning the correct output is already known.
What is unsupervised learning,Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns groupings or structures in the dataset.
What is reinforcement learning,Reinforcement learning is a technique where an agent learns actions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
What is overfitting,Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data because it memorizes patterns instead of learning them.
What is underfitting,Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture patterns in the data resulting in low accuracy on both training and test sets.
What is a neural network,A neural network is a computational structure inspired by the human brain made of interconnected layers of nodes that learn patterns from data.
What is a convolutional neural network,A convolutional neural network is a type of deep learning model used for image tasks such as classification detection and segmentation.
What is computer vision,Computer vision is a field of AI that enables machines to analyze understand and interpret visual data such as images and videos.
What is image classification,Image classification is the task of predicting which category an image belongs to using an AI model.
What is object detection,Object detection identifies objects in an image and draws boxes around them along with labels such as person car or dog.
What is YOLO,YOLO is a fast object detection model that detects multiple objects in an image in a single forward pass.
What is OpenCV,OpenCV is an open source computer vision library used for image processing video analysis and AI applications.
What is data preprocessing,Data preprocessing prepares raw data by cleaning normalizing and transforming it so the model can learn effectively.
What is normalization,Normalization scales numeric values to a consistent range to improve model training speed and stability.
What are epochs,Epochs represent how many times the model sees the entire training dataset during training.
What is a loss function,A loss function measures how wrong the model is during training so the optimizer can adjust the weights.
What is gradient descent,Gradient descent is an optimization method that updates model weights to reduce the loss function.
What is accuracy,Accuracy is a metric that measures the percentage of correct predictions made by a model.
What is precision,Precision measures how many predicted positive results are correct out of all predicted positive results.
What is recall,Recall measures how many actual positive results were correctly predicted by the model.
What is a confusion matrix,A confusion matrix is a table that shows correct and incorrect predictions for each class helping evaluate model performance.
What is data augmentation,Data augmentation creates modified versions of images such as rotated flipped or zoomed images to improve model training.
What is model deployment,Model deployment is the process of making a trained model available for real world use through APIs or apps.
What is transfer learning,Transfer learning uses a pre trained model and fine tunes it for a new task saving time and improving performance.
What is fine tuning,Fine tuning means training a pre trained model on your dataset with a small learning rate to adapt it to your task.
What is tokenization in NLP,Tokenization splits text into words or subwords so models can understand and process language.
How does cosine similarity work,Cosine similarity measures how similar two text vectors are by calculating the angle between them smaller angles mean higher similarity.
What is TF IDF,TF IDF is a text representation technique that measures how important a word is within a document compared to all other documents.
What is model evaluation,Model evaluation refers to testing model performance using metrics like accuracy precision recall and F1 score.
Why do we split data into train and test sets,We split data so the model can learn from one portion and be tested on unseen data to check generalization.
What is a bounding box,A bounding box is a rectangular outline drawn around an object detected in an image.
What is data labeling,Data labeling means assigning correct tags or annotations to images text or audio for machine learning tasks.
